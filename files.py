	1.Can read
	2.Can not write
r+ -- 
	1.Can write if file exist
	2.If file does not exist then it will trough error while opening
	3.We have to use seek to read the file from the beginning, if we dont want to close
w --
	1.If file does not exist it wont throw error and it will create the file
	2.Everytime it ill override previous content
	3.We cant read the file, until we close and open in r or r+ 
w+ --
	1. We can read only if we are writing something
	2. If we want to read, we need not to
