'''
try, except are keywords used to define exceptions. 
ZeroDivisionError is standard catch exception. 
FileNotFound is standard catch exception if no file found. 
try, expect, expect etc (i.e multiple except clauses can be used). 
NameError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError,FileNotFoundError, ImportError are some examples of builtin exceptions. 
we can add else stmt after except block. code in else block will get executed, when try block throws no exceptions. 
code after finally block ALWAYS gets executed irrespective of try, exception blocks.

#Try / Except / Else / Finally - handling an exception when it occurs and telling Python to keep executing the rest of the lines of code in the program
try:
    print(4/0) #in the "try" clause you insert the code that you think might generate an exception at some point
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division Error!") #specifying what exception types Python should expect as a consequence of running the code inside the "try" block and how to handle them
else:
    print("No exceptions raised by the try block!") #executed if the code inside the "try" block raises NO exceptions
finally:
    print("I don't care if an exception was raised or not!") #executed whether the code inside the "try" block raises an exception or not
 
#result of the above block
Division Error!
I don't care if an exception was raised or not!
