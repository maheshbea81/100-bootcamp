1. tuples are immutable, i.e cannot add/remove any elements. 
2. create tuple using tup=(), if there is only one element in tuple, you have to add , at the end of element, like tup=(9,) or tupl=('A',)
3. tuples supports indexing 
4. in comparision to frozen sets, frozensets are also immutable, but unique elements, whereas tuples doesn't have to be unique. 
5. variable mapping and unmapping, tupl=('ABC''DEF','FGI'), we can assign elements to variables using single line like this (a,b,c)=tupl, this will assign a='ABC',b='DEF and c='FGI'.
   this variable assignment works for lists,sets and strings ALSO. 
6. (a,b,c)=(1,2,3) is easy way of defining multiple variables, this also works for sets, strings and lists. 
7. a=(), b=[], if you want to know what builtin methods available for lists and tuples , use dir(a) or dir(b) will list ALL available methods. 
8. tuples and frozensets usually have less methods. 
9. len, min, max, tuple1+tuple2 and indexing works in tuples.
