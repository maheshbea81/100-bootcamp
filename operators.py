''' BODMOS -evaluation
1. order of execution in expression, first power, divison and multiplication in same level, but execution happens left to right.
2. pow(2,3) or 2**3 -- is used to print 2 power 3, 8
3. 5//2 --> will give integer output of quotient, 2
4. 5/2 --> 2.5 , division always gives float out of quotient.
5. 5%2 (modulo), will give reminder.

# Numbers
num1 = 10
num2 = 2.5

type(num1)  # checking the type of this variable; integer
type(num2)  # checking the type of this variable; float

# Numbers - math operations
1 + 2  # addition

2 â€“ 1  # subtraction

4 / 2  # division

4 * 2  # multiplication

4 ** 2  # raising to a power

5 % 2  # modulo (this means finding out the remainder after division of one number by another)

# Numbers - float division vs. integer division (special case)
3 / 2  # float division; result is 1 in Python 2 and 1.5 in Python 3

3 // 2  # integer division; result is 1 in Python 2 and Python 3

# Numbers - order of evaluation in math operations
# Highest priority: raising to a power; Medium priority: division, multiplication and modulo; Low priority: addition and subtraction
100 - 5 ** 2 / 5 * 2  # 1st: 5 ** 2, second: / then *, third - ; result is 90.0

# Numbers - conversion between numeric types
int(1.5)  # result is 1

float(2)  # result is 2.0

# Numbers - useful functions
abs(5)  # the distance between the number in between parantheses and 0

abs(-5)  # returns the same result as abs(5)

max(1, 2)  # returns the largest number

min(1, 2)  # returns the smallest number

pow(3, 2)  # another way of raising to a power
